# github-user-search-app
This repository contains my solution to the "GitHub User Search App" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The application allows users to search for GitHub profiles by username, displaying relevant information fetched from the GitHub Users API. Key features include a responsive design, light and dark theme toggle, and dynamic error handling.

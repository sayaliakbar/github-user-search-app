# Frontend Mentor - GitHub User Search App

This repository contains my solution to the [GitHub user search app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6). The application allows users to search for GitHub profiles by username, displaying relevant information fetched from the GitHub Users API. Key features include a responsive design, light and dark theme toggle, and dynamic error handling.
